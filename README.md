# Classification-of-music-genres-with-CNN 🎵
Classification of music genres using GTZAN dataset. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze audio features and accurately predict the genre.

## Features 🚀
Mel-Spectrogram Creation: Converts audio signals into visually interpretable spectrograms for feature extraction.
MFCC Extraction: Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for audio analysis.
Data Augmentation: Improves model generalization by applying transformations to audio data.
Data visualisation: Visualizing audios prior to and after modifications. 

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
Python: Core programming language for the project.
TensorFlow: Used to build and train the CNN model.
Librosa: Library for audio processing and feature extraction.
Matplotlib: Visualizes audio features and training progress.

Dataset 📁
The project uses the GTZAN Dataset, which contains audio samples for various music genres.
